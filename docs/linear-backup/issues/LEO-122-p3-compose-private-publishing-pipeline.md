## Description

### Owner experience

Leo's wording retained; optional `/post polish`

### Backend action / failure

Private Postgres draft; RQ generates Markdown/front matter. First line defaults title; collision-safe stable slug; photo order retained. Zero LLM required. Optional cleanup is one bounded free call; cannot invent quantities, times, opinions, captions, facts. Show edits and original.

Extend **existing kimaki**, using a private channel such as `#site-drafts`. Add a narrow handler and authenticated internal FastAPI endpoints; do not operate another general-purpose bot or route messages into unrestricted coding-agent execution. Verify kimaki's extension seam during implementation; this handler is new work.

Reuse personal-api's Postgres/Redis/RQ infrastructure, but add **private** draft tables/routes, not publicly readable `/api/posts` or album reads. Published Markdown/media in Git are the public source of truth; API holds workflow receipts/drafts. Notes require no NAS reads after publication. Back up drafts, originals, receipts.

Publisher credentials are repo-scoped, separate from inference keys, unavailable to public workers/models. Fixed build commands operate on content only; uploads cannot alter templates, scripts, dependencies, or destinations. Document setup/recovery in `services/site-publisher/README.md` before unattended publishing. One preview/one click replaces manual Git work without publishing casual chatter automatically.

### Launch budget: $0 in purchased inference

OpenRouter currently documents **50 requests/day and 20/minute** for unfunded free-model use; qualifying credit purchases increase the daily allowance. More keys do not create account quota. Availability is opportunistic, not an SLA. [OpenRouter limits](<https://openrouter.ai/docs/api_reference/limits>), [published free-tier figures](<https://openrouter.ai/blog/tutorials/how-to-get-the-lowest-cost-llm-inference-on-openrouter/>).

**Site ceiling: 40 upstream attempts per UTC day, six/minute, one in flight globally.** Deployment checks actual limits, eligibility, competing account usage; reduce this ceiling when needed. No paid fallback, auto-top-up, quota-evading key rotation, or trial-credit dependence. Free describes inference billing; NAS electricity/storage/bandwidth/maintenance still cost something.

| Reservation | Attempts/day | Max input/output tokens per attempt | Buys |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Farm | 16 | 2,000 / 256 | Two episodes, each six decisions plus two retries |
| Jobs | 12 | 3,000 / 500 | Four runs, each two scores plus one retry |
| AI-Leo | 8 | 2,500 / 400 | Eight uncached answers, no retry |
| Optional post polish | 2 | 4,000 / 1,000 | Two cleanups; long posts use deterministic formatting |
| Verification reserve | 2 | 3,000 / 500 | Smoke probes, not continual inference health checks |
| **Total** | **40** | **≤102,000 input / ≤16,296 output tokens/day** | Hard ceilings, not promised throughput |

* A server-side gateway holds the OpenRouter key. Pin tested `:free` model IDs/provider policy per feature in deployment config. No browser model/provider/key selection; no random free router for recorded comparisons. Verify zero-priced routes and schema/language behavior before release. Record exact model ID in captures; retired/unavailable model → fail closed. Model selection is a deployment gate, not a promise that today's model exists in 90 days.
* Redis atomically reserves each run's maximum attempts and enforces shared caps. Postgres durably records reservations/attempts so Redis restart cannot replenish quota. Reserve before enqueue; idempotency prevents double reservation. Failed calls/retries count conservatively. Release safely expired unused reservations; never refund unknown sent attempts. Disable implicit SDK retries and model-fallback loops.
* Budgets span locales/features and the provider account. No automatic transfer between allocations. Other account usage reduces availability; provider 429 overrides the local ledger.
* Per signed anonymous session and hashed-IP bucket: one fresh Job run/day, two AI-Leo answers/day, one farm-create request/day. Watching/replay consumes no model quota. Use short-lived capabilities, origin checks, payload limits and gateway limits together; CORS is not abuse prevention. Distributed abuse can still exhaust the allowance; accept replay as the degraded experience.
* Honor Retry-After; do not hold visitors through long throttles. Circuit-break repeated errors/exhaustion. Message: “Today's live allowance is used; explore the recorded example.” Do not promise an unverified provider reset time.

### Acceptance criteria

* **Publisher/privacy:** wrong author/stale Publish rejected; duplicate events yield one draft; malformed media/Markdown cannot execute scripts; deployment recoverable; no originals/drafts/secrets/Jellyfin/private text in public output/history. Published content hash verified.
* Implement the exact stage behavior, limits and failures above; F9: private Discord photos/text → draft → private preview → one Publish click → verified article link; no terminal/Markdown editing.

Specification: revised 2026-09-10, `tasks/site-v2-storyboard.md`; requirements are reproduced here so this issue can be implemented from Linear.
